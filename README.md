# Heat pumps and sanitary installations Ekoterm
A website I created for Ekoterm, a company based in KÅ‚odawa, Poland, that specializes in installing heat pumps. The site was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5. I was responsible for the entire process, including design, development, and optimization.
